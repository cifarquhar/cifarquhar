# Hello World, I'm Colin. 

I offer technical training and content creation through [MicroSkills Training](https://www.microskillstraining.co.uk/). I can also advise on the most appropriate approach when providing training for your organisation and help you develop your own training function.

My teaching experience covers bootcamp delivery to adult learners at CodeClan and then with Bright Network Technology Academy. I have worked with career changers and with recent graduates, delivering content covering full-stack software engineering and data analysis both in-person and virtually.

When I'm not teaching my personal projects usually involve combinations of React, Spring and trying to do something useful with a Raspberry Pi. GraphQL has been on my "to learn" list for a long time, along with Svelte, Electron, .NET, improving my  R skills and not procrastinating so much.

I'm kicking around some ideas to do online training content slightly differently - updates to follow if anything gets off the ground...
