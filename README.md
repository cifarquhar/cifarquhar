# Hello World, I'm Colin. 

![Snake animation](https://github.com/cifarquhar/cifarquhar/blob/output/github-contribution-grid-snake.svg)

I'd love to say that animation was mine, but I added it while experimenting with setting up GitHub Actions. [The instructions I followed are here.](https://blog.arnabghosh.me/add-github-dark-snake-animation-readme)

I lead the training team at [Bright Network Technology Academy](https://techacademy.brightnetwork.co.uk/) where we offer a free software engineering course to aspiring graduates. We cover Java, Spring, JavaScript and React in instructor-led training backed up with opportunities for self-directed further study and group projects.

Previously I was an instructor for both the software development and data analysis courses at [CodeClan](https://www.codeclan.com) and prior to that took the software course myself! I have a PhD in machine learning and a background in mathematics, so if anyone has an idea for a Spring app learning about number theory I'm all ears... ðŸ‘€

When I'm not teaching my personal projects usually involve combinations of React, Spring and trying to do something useful with a Raspberry Pi. GraphQL has been on my "to learn" list for a long time, along with Svelte, Electron, improving my  R skills and not procrastinating so much.

I've got a [website](http://www.talesoftheoverthough.dev) where I haven't made a blog post in a criminally long time and last tweeted from [@colinf87](https://twitter.com/colinf87) in January 2021.
