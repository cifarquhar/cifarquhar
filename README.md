# Hello World, I'm Colin.

Everyone seems to have a cool picture first, but unfortunately I can only *just* manage stick figures on a good day. I'll get round to it eventually...

I'm an instructor at [CodeClan](www.codeclan.com) where we teach Python, Java and JavaScript. I took the course myself after studying mathematics and then machine learning at university, with a period spend working as a dev before coming back as an instructor.

When I'm not teaching my personal projects often involve combinations of React, Spring and trying to do something useful with a Raspberry Pi. I'm currently working on a version of the dice game Yahtzee to play with friends and family. I should be finished just in time for lockdown finishing completely when we'll be able to play in person again.

I've got a [website](www.colinfarquhar.dev) which has been criminally neglected and rarely tweet [@colinf87](https://twitter.com/colinf87).
