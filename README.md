# Hello World, I'm Colin. 

I'm a software engineering trainer who is currently between roles and would be interested in hearing about any new opportunities!

Most recently I was the senior trainer at [Bright Network Technology Academy](https://techacademy.brightnetwork.co.uk/) covering Java, Spring, JavaScript and React in instructor-led training backed up with opportunities for self-directed further study and group projects. Previously I was an instructor for both the software development and data analysis courses at [CodeClan](https://www.codeclan.com) and prior to that took the software course myself! I have a PhD in machine learning and a background in mathematics, so if anyone has an idea for a Spring app learning about number theory I'm all ears... ðŸ‘€

When I'm not teaching my personal projects usually involve combinations of React, Spring and trying to do something useful with a Raspberry Pi. GraphQL has been on my "to learn" list for a long time, along with Svelte, Electron, improving my  R skills and not procrastinating so much.

I'm kicking around some ideas to do online training content slightly differently - updates to follow if anything gets off the ground...
